CORE SUMMARY
I build complete products end-to-end: UI, backend APIs, databases, authentication, admin dashboards, and integrations.
My main stack is React / React Native / Node.js / Firebase. I also do Three.js and Blender for 3D experiences.

WHAT I BUILD

* Mobile apps (iOS/Android) with React Native
* Web apps (React / Next.js)
* Backends (Node.js / Express)
* Firebase systems (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
* CRM dashboards (role-based access, workflows, admin tools)
* Integrations (Mailgun for email, Stripe for payments)

WORKING STYLE

* Fast prototype first, then production polish
* Clean UI, responsive layout, performance-focused
* Clear communication and weekly updates
* I prefer simple, reliable architecture and shipping fast
